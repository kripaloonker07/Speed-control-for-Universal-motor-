# Speed-control-for-Universal-motor-
Speed of the universal motor can be controlled using an AC dimmer circuit by adjusting the average voltage supplied to it. This is done through phase angle control, 
where a TRIAC delays conduction in each AC cycle to chop the waveform. As a result, the power delivered to the motor is reduced, lowering its speed. This method allows
for smooth and efficient control, making it ideal for various DIY projects and practical applications.
